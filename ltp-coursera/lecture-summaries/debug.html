			IDLE's Debugger
		</h1>
		<h3>
			Debug Control
		</h3>
		<p>
		The Python Visualizer has limitations: it does not allow import statements,
		and it stops tracing after 500 steps.  IDLE comes with a debugger, which is a tool that works a lot like the visualizer but without the pretty pictures.

		To run a program in IDLE's debugger, the steps are:
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure the Python Shell window is on top and select Debug->Debugger.
			This opens a window called "Debug Control".</li>

			<li>Check the checkbox for Source.</li>

			<li>Open a Python file (ends in .py) where you have saved your program. </li>

			<li>Select Run->Run Module. This will change the contents of Debug Control.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<h3>
			Understanding The Debug Window
		</h3>
		<p>
			Step is like Forward in the visulizer: it executes the current instruction. We click Step to "step" through the program. The Debug Control window will highlight the current line being executed. It will also show the current variables in the "Locals" pane. The middle pane shows the current stack frames and the current lines of code for each. We can switch back and forth between them to see the variables.
