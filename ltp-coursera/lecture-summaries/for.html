		<h3>
			For Loops
		</h3>
		<p>The general form of a for loop over a string is:
		<pre>
for variable in str:
    body
		</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			The variable refers to each character of the string in turn and executes the body of the loop for each character. For example:
		</p>
		
<pre>
>>> s = 'yesterday'
>>> for char in s:
...     print(char)
... 
y
e
s
t
e
r
d
a
y    
</pre>

        <h3>Accumulator pattern: numeric accumulator</h3>
		<p>
            Consider the code below, in which the variable <code>num_vowels</code> is an accumulator:
        </p>
<pre>
def count_vowels(s):
    ''' (str) -> int

    Return the number of vowels in s. Do not treat letter y as a vowel
    
    >>> count_vowels('Happy Anniversary!')
    5
    >>> count_vowels('xyz')
    0    
    '''

    num_vowels = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char in 'aeiouAEIOU':
            num_vowels = num_vowels + 1

    return num_vowels
</pre>

		<p>
			The <code>loop</code> in the function above will loop over each character that <code>s</code> refers to, in turn. The body of the loop is executed for each character, and when a character is a vowel, the <code>if</code> condition is <code>True</code> and the value that <code>num_vowels</code> refers to is increased by one.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The variable <code>num_vowels</code> is an accumulator, because it accumulates information. It starts out referring to the value <code>0</code> and by the end of the function it refers to the number of vowels in <code>s</code>.
		</p>

<h3>Accumulator pattern: string accumulator</h3>
		<p>
            In the following function, the variable <code>vowels</code> is also an accumulator:
        </p>
  
<pre>      
def collect_vowels(s):
    ''' (str) -> str

    Return the vowels from s.  Do not treat the letter
    y as a vowel.

    >>> collect_vowels('Happy Anniversary!')
    'aAiea'
    >>> collect_vowels('xyz')
    ''
    '''

    vowels = ''

    for char in s:
        if char in 'aeiouAEIOU':
            vowels = vowels + char

    return vowels
</pre>

<p>
Variable <code>vowels</code> initially refers to the empty string, but over the course of the function it accumulates the vowels from <code>s</code>.
