<h1>Structuring <code>if</code> Statements</h1>

<h3><code>if-elif</code> vs. <code>if-if</code></h3>
<p>
An <code>if</code> statement with an <code>elif</code> clause is a single statement. The expressions are evaluated from top to bottom until one evaluates to <code>True</code> or until there are no expressions left to evaluate. When an expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, the body associated with it is executed and then the <code>if</code> statement exits. Any subsequent expressions are ignored. For example:
    <pre>
    grade1 = 70
    grade2 = 80

    if grade1 >= 50:
        print('You passed a course with grade: ', grade1)
    elif grade2 >= 50:
        print('You passed a course with grade: ', grade2)
    </pre>

<p>The <code>if</code> statement condition (<code>grade1 >= 50</code>) evaluates to <code>True</code>, so the body associated with the <code>if</code> is executed and then the <code>if</code> exits. The <code>elif</code> condition is not even evaluated in this case.
</p>

<p>It is possible for <code>if</code> statements to appear one after another in a program. Although they are be adjacent to each other, they are completely independent of each other and it is possible for the body of each <code>if</code> to be executed. For example:
    <pre>
    grade1 = 70
    grade2 = 80

    if grade1 >= 50:
        print('You passed a course with grade: ', grade1)
    if grade2 >= 50:
        print('You passed a course with grade: ', grade2)
    </pre>

In the program above, the condition associated with the first <code>if</code> statement (<code>grade1 >= 50</code>) evaluates to <code>True</code>, so the body associated  with it is executed. The condition associated with the second <code>if</code> statement (<code>grade2 >= 50</code>) also evaluates to <code>True</code>, so the body associated with it is also executed. 
</p>

<h3>Nested <code>if</code>s</h3>

<p>It is possible to place an <code>if</code> statement within the body of another <code>if</code> statement. For example:
    <pre>
    if precipitation:
        if temperature > 0:
            print('Bring your umbrella!')
        else:
            print('Wear your snow boots and winter coat!)   
    </pre>

<p>The statement above can be simplified by removing some of the nesting.  The message <code>'Bring your umbrella!'</code> is printed only when both of the <code>if</code> statement conditions are <code>True</code>.  The message <code>'Wear your snow boots and winter coat!'</code> is printed only when the outer <code>if</code> condition is <code>True</code>, but the inner <code>if</code> condition is <code>False</code>.  The following is equivalent to the code above:</p>

<pre>
if precipitation and temperature > 0:
    print('Bring your umbrella')
elif precipitation:
    print('Wear your snow boots and winter coat!')
</pre>
