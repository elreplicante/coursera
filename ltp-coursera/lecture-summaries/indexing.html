			<code>str</code>: indexing and slicing
		</h1>
		<h3>
			Indexing
		</h3>
		<p>
			An index is a position within the string. Positive indices count from the left-hand side with the first character at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. Negative indices count from the right-hand side with the last character at index -1, the second last at index -2, and so on.  For the string <code>"Learn to Program"</code>, the indices are:<br/>

		</p>

		<p>
			The first character of the string is at index 0 and can be accessed using this bracket notation:
<pre>
>>> s[0]
'L'
>>> s[1]
'e'
</pre>

			Negative indices are used to count from the end (from the right-hand side):

<pre>
>>> s[-1]
'm'
>>> s[-2]
'a'
</pre>

		<h3>
			Slicing
		</h3>
		<p>
			We can extract more than one character using slicing. A slice is a substring from the start index up to but not including the end index. For example:
<pre>
>>> s[0:5]
'Learn'
>>> s[6:8]
'to'
>>> s[9:16]
'Program'
</pre>

		More generally, the end of the string can be represented using its length:
<pre>
>>> s[9:len(s)]
'Program'
</pre>

The end index may be omitted entirely and the default is <code>len(s)</code>:
<pre>
>>> s[9:]
'Program'
</pre>

Similarly, if the start index is omitted, the slice starts from index 0:
<pre>
>>> s[:]
'Learn to Program'
>>> s[:8]
'Learn to'
</pre>

Negative indices can be used for slicing too.  The following three expressions are equivalent:
<pre>
>>> s[1:8]
'earn to'
>>> s[1:-8]
'earn to'
>>> s[-15:-8]
'earn to'
</pre>
		</p>

		<h3>
			Modifying Strings
		</h3>

		<p>
			The slicing and indexing operations do not modify the string that they act on, so the string that <code>s</code> refers to is unchanged by the operations above.  In fact, we cannot change a string.  Operations like the following result in errors:

<pre>
>>> s[6] = 'd'
Traceback (most recent call last):
	File <"pyshell#19", line 1, in <module>
		s[6] = 'd'
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine that we want to change string <code>s</code> to refer to <code>'Learned to Program'</code>. The following expression evaluates to that <code>'Learned to Program'</code>: <code>s[:5] + 'ed' + s[5:]</code>
		</p>

		<p>
			The variable <code>s</code> gets the new string: <code>s = s[:5] + 'ed' + s[5:]</code>
		</p>

		<p>
			Notice that the string that <code>s</code> originally referred to was not modified: strings cannot be modified. Instead a new string was created and <code>s</code> was changed to point to that string.
