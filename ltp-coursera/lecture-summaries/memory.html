<h1>Python and Computer Memory</h1>

<h3>Computer Memory</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this course, you may think of <em>computer memory</em> as a long list of storage locations where each location is identified with a unique number and each location houses a value. This unique number is called a <em>memory address</em>. Typically, we will write memory addresses as a number with an "x" as a prefix to distinguish them from other numbers (for example, <code>x201</code> is memory address 201).</p>
<p>Variables are a way to keep track of values stored in computer memory. A <em>variable</em> is a named location in computer memory. Python keeps variables in a separate list from values. A variable will store a memory address, and it is that memory address that stores the value. The variable then refers to the value. Python will pick the memory addresses for you.</p> 

<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>
A value has a memory address.<br/>
A variable stores a memory address.<br/>
A variable refers to a value.<br/>
A variable points to a value.<br/>
</p>

<p>Example:
Value <code>8.5</code> has memory address <code>x34</code>.<br/>
Variable <code>shoe_size</code> stores memory address <code>x34</code>.<br/>
The value of <code>shoe_size</code> is <code>8.5</code>.<br/>
<code>shoe_size</code> refers to value <code>8.5</code>.<br/>
<code>shoe_size</code> points to value <code>8.5</code>.<br/>
