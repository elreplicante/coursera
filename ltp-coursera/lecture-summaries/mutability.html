		<h3>
			Mutability
		</h3>
		<p>
			We say that lists are <i>mutable</i>: they can be modified. All the other types we have seen so far (<code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code> and <code>bool</code>) are <i>immutable</i>: they cannot be modified.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are several examples of lists being modified:
<pre>
>>> classes = ['chem', 'bio', 'cs', 'eng']
>>>
>>> # Elements can be added:
>>> classes.append('math')
>>> classes
['chem', 'bio', 'cs', 'eng', 'math']
>>>
>>> # Elements can be replaced:
>>> classes[1] = 'soc'
>>> classes
['chem', 'soc', 'cs', 'eng', 'math']
>>>
>>> # Elements can be removed:
>>> classes.pop()
'math'
>>> classes
['chem', 'soc', 'cs', 'eng']
</pre>

	<h3>
		Aliasing
	</h3>
	<p>
		Consider the following code:
	</p>

<pre>
>>> lst1 = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
>>> lst2 = lst1
>>> lst1[-1] = 18
>>> lst2
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18]
</pre>

	<p>
		After the second statement executes, <code>lst1</code> and <code>lst2</code> both refer to the same list. When two variables refer to the same objects, they are <em>aliases</em>.  If that list is modified, both of <code>lst1</code> and <code>lst2</code> will see the change.
